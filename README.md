# UNREALxMATLAB

Tools:
- Unreal Engine 4.26.2
- MATLAB R2022a
- MATLAB Simulink R2022a

Autonomous vessels simulated in MATLAB Simulink, with the vessels rendered and visualized in the Unreal Engine game engine.

The current vessels include:
- 1 Autonomous Drone.
- 1 Ship Vessel

The generated environment simulates an artic region using Unreal Engine, with the vessels able to navigate across the region from point to point.

The vessels simulated in MATLAB contain different sensors, granting them both Visual, Audio and LiDAR capabilities.
